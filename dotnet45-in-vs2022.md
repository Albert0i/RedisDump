You can absolutely open a .NET Framework 4.5 project in Visual Studio 2022 **without upgrading to 4.8**, but it takes a bit of manual setup since Microsoft no longer ships the 4.5 developer pack with VS2022 by default.

### üõ†Ô∏è Workaround Steps
To make it work, you‚Äôll need to **manually install the reference assemblies** for .NET 4.5:

1. **Download the NuGet package**  
   Get `Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies.net45` from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies.net45)

2. **Extract the package**  
   - Rename the `.nupkg` file to `.zip`
   - Extract it using 7-Zip or any archive tool

3. **Copy reference assemblies**  
   - Navigate to:  
     `build\.NETFramework\v4.5\` inside the extracted folder  
   - Copy all files to:  
     `C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETFramework\v4.5`

4. **Restart Visual Studio 2022**  
   - Close and reopen VS2022
   - Your project should now load without prompting for an upgrade

### üß† Pro Tips
- If you already have a `v4.5` folder, back it up before replacing files.
- You can also add the NuGet package directly to your project for design-time support without modifying system folders.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads-Up
.NET Framework 4.5 is **out of support**, so while this workaround lets you maintain legacy compatibility, it‚Äôs best used for short-term maintenance or migration prep.

Let me know if you want help automating this setup or exploring how to containerize the build for consistency across environments.
