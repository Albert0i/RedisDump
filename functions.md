 "    Create a new library with the given library name and code."
 "DELETE <LIBRARY NAME>"
 "    Delete the given library."
 "LIST [LIBRARYNAME PATTERN] [WITHCODE]"
 "    Return general information on all the libraries:"
 "    * Library name"
 "    * The engine used to run the Library"
1 "    * Library description"

1 "    * Library code (if WITHCODE is give"
1 "    It also possible to get only function that matches a pattern using LIBRARYNAME argument."
1 "STATS"

2 "KILL"
2 "    Kill the current running function."
2 "FLUSH [ASYNC|SYNC]"
